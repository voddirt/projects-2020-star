# Inaugural project

This project investigates the effect of income taxation on consumption and labor supply. The study result shows that higher income implies both consumption and leisure increase. Further the project investigates how the parameters affect total tax revenue and the optimal cut off for the top tax. We found that a lower elasticity of labor supply leads to a higher tax revenue.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
