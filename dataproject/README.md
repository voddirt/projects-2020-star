# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Comparison of Covid19 death tolls in Scandinavia** and is about how The Scandinavian countries manage the corona crisis in different ways. Denmark has responded quickly with far-reaching goverment initiatives whereas Sweden is against the so-called "authoritarian" strategy. For this reason, it is interesting to investigate the scandinavian death tolls associated with their different national attitudes towards the management of the corona crisis. Note that covid19 might be a "harvesting" phenomenon regarding cause of death.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. INDKP101.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/INDKP101
1. RAS200.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/RAS200

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
